# Graphics Test
This repo is meant to be my sandbox for learning some new things. I aim for it to be very clean, and do as many things right as I can, from a design perspective. Some goals include:
- [x] CMake: Using [CMake](https://cmake.org/), I designed a build system based off of that of [Dolphin](https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin), changing things to how I thought they made more sense, and adapting them better for my purposes.
- [ ] Logging
- [ ] Qt
- [ ] OpenGL
